- Implement core data structures from scratch
- Master common algorithmic patterns
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Build a strong foundation for technical interviews

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Data Structures
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists (Singly & Doubly)
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Tries

### Algorithms
- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Shortest Path)
- Backtracking
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Consistency is Key**: Solve at least one problem daily
2. **Understanding > Memorization**: Focus on understanding patterns
3. **Time Your Solutions**: Practice with interview-like conditions
4. **Review & Reflect**: Regularly revisit previous solutions
5. **Engage with Others**: Share and discuss solutions with the community

## 📈 Future Goals

- Complete all easy/medium LeetCode problems in target topics
- Implement all fundamental data structures from scratch
- Create visual explanations for complex algorithms
- Share knowledge through blog posts/tutorials
